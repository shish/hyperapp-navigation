HyperApp Navigation
===================

A hyperapp `Subscriber` and `Effect` to push URL changes to the URL bar
when links are clicked, and react to the back / forward button being
pressed, so that navigation events are all handled in-app with no page
reloads.

See [demo.html](demo.html) for a self-contained, well-commented example.
